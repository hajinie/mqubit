**General Template:**

You:  
Suppose you are {an expert in the interdisciplinary field of chemistry and AI.}  
Given a set of reactant SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System), your task is {to employ your expertise in the interdisciplinary field of chemistry and AI to predict the properties of the molecules based on your knowledge of chemical property prediction.}  

**Task-specific Template:**

Please strictly follow the format, no other information can be provided. Given the SMILES string of a molecule, the task focuses on predicting molecular taste properties, specifically whether a molecule is sweet or bitter, based on the SMILES string representation of each molecule. You will be provided with several example molecules, each accompanied by a binary label indicating whether the molecule is sweet (1) or bitter (0). Please answer with only 1 or 0.

**ICL:**
